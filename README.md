# ARQ-Simulator

The simulator demonstrates how ARQ protocols handle frame transmission, acknowledgements, losses, and retransmissions in a controlled environment. Users can dynamically adjust window sizes, total frames, and loss scenarios to observe protocol behavior and efficiency.

### Key Features

* Interactive simulation of **Go-Back-N** and **Selective Repeat** protocols
* Configurable parameters: window size, number of frames, frame loss and ACK loss scenarios
* Real-time visualization of frame states (waiting, sent, acknowledged)
* Performance metrics including:

  * Frames transmitted
  * Retransmissions
  * Acknowledgements
  * Transmission efficiency
* Clean, responsive UI for intuitive learning and experimentation

### Tech Stack

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3** (modern gradients, animations, responsive layout)
* **JavaScript** (protocol logic, state management, real-time updates)

### Learning Outcomes

* Understand reliable data transfer mechanisms
* Compare efficiency and retransmission strategies of ARQ protocols
* Visualize protocol performance under packet loss conditions

### Use Cases

* Computer Networks coursework
* Academic demonstrations and labs
* Interview preparation for networking fundamentals
* Self-learning and protocol experimentation
